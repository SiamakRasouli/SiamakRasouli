### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My programming career began in 2005 as a front-end developer, followed by a full-stack PHP developer career in 2015. After a short time, I decided to use the Codeigniter framework. My current framework of choice is Laravel.
Learning and programming daily improve my vitality and productivity.
